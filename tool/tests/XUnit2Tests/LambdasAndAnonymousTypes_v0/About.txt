This test uses lambda function to see whether they are collected appropriately.
Previously there was a bug that inspired this test to be made.
The source of bug was a lambda function inside of a generic function.
When instrumenting static field accesses, MonoCecil DeclaringType for a FieldReference
returns different name than got through TypeDefinition, namely MonoCecil includes generic parameter
in a name, e.g. <T>. This caused trouble with selection.
