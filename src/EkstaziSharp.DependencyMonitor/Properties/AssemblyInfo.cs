// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version 
//      Build Number
//      Revision
//
// You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers 
// by using the '*' as shown below:
// [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")]
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")]

// Mark assembly as Security Transparent.
// Security Transparent code can be called from both
// Security Critical and Security Transparent code,
// while Security Critical cannot be called from Security Transparent code.
// So, this enables that DependencyMonitor can be called from Security Transparent code.
